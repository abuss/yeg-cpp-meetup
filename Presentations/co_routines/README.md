# A cursory look at co_routines

I've been co_awaiting the release of co-routines in C++. Hopefully, sometime in the near std::future, we'll all be able to use them.

At this meetup, we'll discuss the topic of coroutines, and their use in C++. The presentation will include a brief overview, small tutorial, and some hidden gotchas.
